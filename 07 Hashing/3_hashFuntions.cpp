/*
    Take a large universe of keys (Phone Numbers, Names, Employe ID) ------>>>>> Use a funtion called "Hash Funtion" ------->>>> convert large keys in small values that can be use as a small index in an array



  How Hash Functions work?
  --> Should always map a large key to same small key
  --> Should generate value from 0 to m-1
  --> Should be fast, O(1) for integers and O(len) for strings of length 'len'
  --> Should uniformly distribute large keys into hash table slots
