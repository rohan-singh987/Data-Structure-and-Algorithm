Problems in Array :
1. Either size is fixed or pre-allocated, the worst case insertion at the end is Ã¸(n)
2. Insertion in middle or beginning is costly
3. Deletion from middle or beginning is costly
4. Implementation of data struct like queue and dequeue is complex arrays

eg-: How to implement Round Robin Scheduling
    [10, 5,  3, 15, 10, 8]          Token Time = 5
     p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5
        
    --> [5,  3, 15, 10,  8,  5]
         p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p0
     
    --> [3, 15, 10, 8, 5]
        p2, p3, p4, p5, p0

    --> [15, 10, 8, 5]
        p3, p4, p5, p0
