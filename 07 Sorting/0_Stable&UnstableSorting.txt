Stable   -: If two items have same value then they should appear in the same order as they appeared in main array
UnStable -: Unstable sorting Algorithm doesn't give shit about apperarence of element in main order

arr[] = {("Rohan", 50), ("Singh", 70), ("Sunny", 50)}

Stable Sorting Algorithm :
arr[] = {("Rohan", 50), ("Sunny", 50), ("Singh",70)}
Stability is important only if objects are of multiple field


UnStable Sorting Algorithm :
arr[] = { ("Sunny", 50), ("Rohan", 50), ("Singh",70)}   (might be same might be not but it will not care about order it only cares about sorting)

Stable Sorting Algorithm -:   Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort
UnStable Sorting Algorithm -: Selection Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
